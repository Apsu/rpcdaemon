RPC Daemon
==========

An AMQP RPC Daemon, primarily for tracking and responding to OpenStack Quantum agent state changes and rescheduling resources appropriately.

It currently supports L3 agents and DHCP agents are coming.

The future plan is to generalize the framework and integrate arbitrary code as callbacks.
